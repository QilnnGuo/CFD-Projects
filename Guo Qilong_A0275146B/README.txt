There are three parts in total.

First parts is the class problem, the other two parts consist of two solvers(1st order and 2nd order).

'kind' is the parameter to determine the solver to solve the problem 1 or 2.

'rec_output_animation_2.gif' represents the evolution of the results by 2nd order HLLC solver.
