Since the '.pkl' files are too large, 11.92GB, I do not upload '.pkl' files:  N=50, dt= 0.0001, (x_0,y_0,r)=(1/3,1/3,1/5).

Use these commands under 'code' folder to run the results I presented.

'nohup python Project_1.py > Project.log 2>&1 &', where output images are in 'output_images';
'nohup python Project_1_new_xyr.py > Project_new.log 2>&1 &', where output images are in 'output_images_new';
'toy_experiment.ipynb' is for small experiments, where output images are in 'output_images_toy'.

The continuous results (all N=200, dt=0.0001) could be observed from the '.gif' files.
'output_animation.gif' for Question 1
'output_animation_new.gif' for Question 2

The selected images for Question 1 and Question 2 are in the folders 'Q1', 'Q2'.

Report is in 'Project1.pdf'
